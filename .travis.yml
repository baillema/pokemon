# We're using Java. Since Travis does not support multiple languages in a same config file, we'll have to find a
# workaround to test our javascript code (should mostly be node.js / angular). One way would be to install what we need
# (node, angular, selenium, etc.) in the before_script and then run tests - we'll try that once needed.
language: java

# Test against the most popular jdk. We limit ourselves to jdk8 for now (especially since the latest version of
# Elasticsearch requires jdk8). We don't have any legacy stuff to work with anyways, so there is no reason to test
# against older stuff.
env:
  - JDK=oraclejdk8

# Using Ubuntu trusty. Note that as of Friday, September 1 2017, trusty became the default value of dist, meaning that
# it is not necessary here. It gives a better idea of what's going on thought, no reason to remove it.
dist: trusty

# Will probably need more work here, e.g installing wildfly before running the script or displaying the logs. Will do it
# when the necessity arises.
